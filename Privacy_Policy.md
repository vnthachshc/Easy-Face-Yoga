Welcome to Easy Face Yoga ("us," "we," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.

If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the App.

### 1. Information We Collect

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

*   **Locally Stored Data:**
    *   Your exercise progress, completed workouts, and history.
    *   Your favorited exercises or programs.
    *   App settings, such as language preferences and reminder configurations.
    *   This data is stored solely on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party by us. You can remove this data by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the App.

*   **In-App Purchase Information:**
    *   If you choose to make an in-app purchase, such as to remove advertisements, the transaction is processed by the respective app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We do not collect or store your payment card details. We receive confirmation from the app store when a purchase is made, which may include a transaction ID and purchase status, to unlock the purchased feature for you. Please review the privacy policy of the respective app store for more details on how they handle your information.

*   **Advertising Identifiers:**
    *   To support the ad-funded version of our App, we may work with third-party advertising networks. These networks may collect and use certain information, such as your device's advertising identifier (e.g., IDFA for iOS, AAID for Android), IP address, device make and model, operating system, and information about your interaction with ads shown in our App. This information is used to provide personalized advertising and to measure ad performance. You can typically control or reset your advertising identifier through your device's privacy settings.

*   **Usage Data & Analytics (Optional - if you implement this):**
    *   We may collect anonymous, aggregated information about your interaction with the App, such as features used, session duration, screens visited, and crash reports. This data helps us understand how our App is being used, identify areas for improvement, and enhance stability. This data, if collected, is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally. (If you use a specific analytics provider like Firebase Analytics, you should mention it here).

### 2. How We Use Your Information

*   Enable core App functionalities, such as tracking your exercise progress and managing your settings, all of which operate locally on your device.
*   Process in-app purchases and unlock features.
*   Deliver targeted advertisements to you, if you are using the ad-supported version of the App.
*   Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the App (if analytics are collected).
*   Diagnose and fix technical issues and bugs.
*   Comply with legal obligations.

### 3. Disclosure of Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations:

*   **With Third-Party Service Providers:**
    *   **Advertising Partners:** We may share information with third-party advertising networks(Google AdMob) to display advertisements in the App. These partners may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect or receive information about you and use that information to provide measurement services and targeted ads.
    *   **In-App Purchase Processing:** As mentioned, IAP transactions are processed by the app stores (Apple, Google).
    *   **(If applicable) Analytics Providers:** If we use analytics services, anonymized and aggregated data may be shared with them.

*   **By Law or to Protect Rights:**
    *   If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.

### 4. Data Security

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information stored locally on your device is subject to your device's security.

### 5. Data Retention

*   **Local Data:** Stored on your device until you delete the app or clear its data.
*   **In-App Purchase Records:** We maintain records of purchase entitlements (e.g., ad-free status) as necessary to provide the service. Transaction details are managed by the respective app stores.
*   **Advertising and Analytics Data:** Retained by third-party services according to their respective privacy policies.

---

### 6. Your Choices and Rights

*   **Managing Local Data:** You can manage or delete data stored locally by the App by clearing the App's data in your device settings or by uninstalling the App.
*   **In-App Purchases:** Purchases are managed through your app store account.
*   **Advertising:** You can often opt-out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device's privacy settings (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android). This will not stop you from seeing ads, but they may be less relevant to you. Please refer to the settings of your device and the policies of our advertising partners for more information.
*   **(If applicable) Access and Correction:** If we were to hold personal data directly, you would have rights to access or correct it. However, as most data is local or managed by third parties, please refer to those parties or your device settings.

### 7. Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information.
